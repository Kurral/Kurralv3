Our list of the top ten countries to move to is based on findings from our expat and digital nomad members, drawn from the areas they tend to report the **best quality of life**, **income to spending ratio**, **education**, and **quality of healthcare**.

Compiled by the United Nations, the Human Development Index is arguably the world’s most comprehensive and practical analysis of each country’s level of development and overall quality of life. 2.
